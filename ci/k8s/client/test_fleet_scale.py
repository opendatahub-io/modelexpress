"""Fleet scale test (row 20): ~15 workers, CRD backend, NIXL-over-TCP P2P.

run-mx-fleet-test has already:
  1. Deployed mx-server with the Kubernetes CRD backend.
  2. Applied the fleet workers Deployment at replicas=1.
  3. Waited for the source worker to reach Ready status.
  4. Scaled in waves to fleet_size total replicas.
  5. Waited for all fleet_size workers to reach Ready status.

Asserts:
  1. At least fleet_size ModelMetadata CRs are Ready. Historical Stale
     generations may remain until GC; other non-Ready states fail the test.
  2. At least fleet_size - 1 worker pods logged "RDMA transfer complete"
     — the one source downloads from HF and does not log this; every
     other worker must have pulled via NIXL (TCP transport on a100a MIG).

Inference correctness from P2P-loaded weights is intentionally NOT checked
here — it is covered thoroughly by test_p2p_k8s.py and test_dynamo_p2p.py.
A single request through the fleet Service would hit only one pod (and
non-deterministically), adding no scale-specific signal.

Invoked by the workflow as:
  pytest ci/k8s/client/test_fleet_scale.py -v \\
      --namespace $NAMESPACE \\
      --model $MX_CI_MODEL \\
      --expected-cr-count $FLEET_SIZE
